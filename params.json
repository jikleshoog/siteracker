App will provide ability to store site URLs, add meta-info about sites upon storage and ability to retrieve sites by their meta-info.\r\n\r\nFrom Urban dictionary: \r\nRacker - Someone who successfully collects sports memorabilia, such as autographs or sports cards that they have been trying hard to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe app name - siteracker - is a play on words: site, tracker and racker and it attempts to be suggestive, unless you are the kind of person that can only give, but never take suggestions :)\r\n\r\nThe original intention is to try an approach based on MEAN stack, pure JS - that is.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
