# Siteracker
Site (t)racker app repository. App will provide ability to store site URLs, add meta-info about sites upon storage and ability to retrieve sites by their meta-info.

From Urban dictionary: 
Racker - Someone who successfully collects sports memorabilia, such as autographs or sports cards that they have been trying hard to obtain.

The app name - siteracker - is a play on words: site, tracker and racker and it attempts to be suggestive, unless you are the kind of person that can only give, but never take suggestions :)

The original intention is to try an approach based on MEAN stack, pure JS - that is.
